# New Tab Edge Extension

This extension has the purpose of enabling a possibility to 
replace the annoying msn homepage set as default page when 
opening a new tab. As it cannot be changed natively, this 
extension provides remedy.

Unfortunately, as of the [Microsoft Store Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/windows/agreements/store-policies#1012-edge-extensions), 
it is not allowed to publish this extension to the Store, as 
it "(...) alters browser functionality or settings including the start or 
home page, the new tab page (...)".

## Installation

You can still install this extension by side-loading it.
For now, the the easiest way is:
- to download/clone this repo
- enable "side-loading of extensions" in [about:flags](about:flags)
- go to settings (...) -> extensions -> add extension
- choose the folder which you just downloaded/cloned
